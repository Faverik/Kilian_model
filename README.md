# Kilian_model
In simple way this is a common fitting program for a certain function.

This program is designed to describe a certain set of quantities (the area of particles) by the statistical model of Kilian.
In principle, it can describe any set of numbers.
To do this, create a data file containing a list of these values
and put the path to the file in "data_file" variable, using the \\ instead \
Than start it, you should see the histogramm and fitting lines
In case of wrong fitting try to change bounds
In fact, it does not work well with three or more ensembles,
as this requires fine-tuning the fitting bounds
In real systems for which it is created, more than two ensembles are not used
